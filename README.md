## Description
This is a website that models the user's carbon footprint via a survey, and also has a minigame called Higher/Lower, where different CO2 emission sources are pitted against each other, and the user's knowledge will be tested. This project was designed and implemented as a solution to the project raised by Fair Carbon Footprint for the course 02122 Software Technology Project.

## Running and debugging
